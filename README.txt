This is a collections of functions or R scripts developed by me over the last years. Most of the files are just old functions or scratches.
This is just a small step I'm doing in the spirit of Open Science.
I'll try to make this folder a bit less messy (but this will require time).  
Hopefully some of this code will be useful to someone, but most of this functions were developed several years ago, so please forgive me for the bad coding.
