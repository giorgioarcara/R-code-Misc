This is a collections of functions or R scripts developed by me over the last years. Most of the files are just old functions or scratches.
This is just a small step I'm doing in the spirit of Open Science (and in the spirit of the article by Goodman et al., 2014 "Rule 6. Publish Your Code (Even the Small Bits)")
I'll try to make this folder a bit less messy and with a better folder structure (but this will require time).  
Please note that most of the code is not commented and if commented,  
Hopefully some of this code will be useful to someone, but most of this functions were developed several years ago, so please forgive me for the bad coding.
